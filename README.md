winky
=====

This will be a wiki with a twist, inspired by MDwiki and Tiddly Wiki.

A winky will be a self editable document. You will be able to open it from your local file system into a browser, edit the content and save it back to the local file system.

The content will be editable in markdown format.

| Feature | Doneness |
| ------- | -------- |
| md editing | 100% |
| md rendering | 80% -- still need to configure to use Github Flavored Markdown. Still need to use Highlight.js for syntax highlighting |
| internal md linking | 100% |
| Styling | 0% -- just needs some good CSS |
| Search | 50% -- needs to be case insensitive and ignore white space variation |
| Download of the modified content | 100% |
| Embed JS dependencies so an Internet connection isn't required for usage. | 0% |
| License | Need to pick a good license for use of winky source code. Perhaps MIT? |
