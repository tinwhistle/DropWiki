DropWiki
========

This will be a wiki with a twist, inspired by [MDwiki](https://github.com/Dynalon/mdwiki) and [TiddlyWiki](https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5).

A DropWiki will be a self editable document. You will be able to open it from your local file system into a browser, edit the content and save it back to the local file system.

The content will be editable in markdown format.
